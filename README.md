# Overview
First attempt at working with Java. Trying to learn the basic syntax of Java with implementing classes, objects, inheritance, methods, variables and loops to further my programming skills. Have previous experience with C++ and it transfered over well to Java. 

Attempting to create a basic ATM program. Allows you to make deposits into either a checkings or savings. Also allows you to make an account and set up a checkings or savings account with an initial deposit. Checkings and savings are subclasses of an account. Pointers for the classes are saved in an ArrayList. Basic methods allow for basic manipulations of the accounts.
